The menu template is designed for persons, restaurants and cafes to create menus with ease.

# Features:

- Responsive Design: The menu template is designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.

# Development
For local development run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

# Localhost inside exampleSite

You can run this site without installing it as a hugo theme using the following command. I use this for theme development.

```
hugo server --source=exampleSite --theme=../..
```
